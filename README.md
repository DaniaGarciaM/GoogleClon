## 👩‍💻 Intro
HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web, and along with CSS3 web pages every day are created. We define the meaning, structure, and style of this website, across these technologies. 

## 🏗️ What did I build?
The project is focused on the construction of the Google interface, paying attention especially, to its UI/UX for replicating its behavior and style to 100%. The interface is divided into the sections below:

* Header: Section where is found the Google main navigation, like pic user profile, icons, and menu.

* Main: Container section for the main elements more important of the interface: logo, search bar, icons, and buttons.
